## [2.6.4] - 2025-08-02

### üöÄ Added
- **New Rotation Engine**: Global IP pool rotation for multiple DNS records.
- **`rotate_ips_with_pool` Function**: Replaces old `rotate_ips_between_records`; supports coordinated multi-record rotation.
- **Shared IP Pool Support**: Each rotation group can now share an IP pool.
- **Persistent Global Index**: Rotation index is now stored and restored from `.cfutils-state.json`.

### üõ† Changed
- Refactored `run_rotation()` to use the new global rotation logic.
- Updated configuration manager to store `rotation_index` as a global value.
- Extended CLI interface:
  - `add_rotation_group_menu` and `edit_rotation_group_menu` now allow IP pool configuration.
- Updated display: `list_rotation_groups()` shows shared IP pool in CLI table.

### üêõ Fixed
- Fixed rotation index bug where order was not consistent across runs.
- Fixed CLI crashes when record or IP list exceeded display width.
- Fixed UI bugs caused by legacy rotation logic in config updates.

### üìö Docs
- Updated `README.md` with new usage instructions and updated example.
- Clarified cron setup recommendation for 1-minute rotation interval.

---

This release improves flexibility and reliability of the rotation system by enabling coordinated rotation across multiple DNS records using a single IP pool. It sets the foundation for intelligent bandwidth-aware rotation in upcoming versions.

## [2.6.4-dev] - 2025-08-01

### Fixed
- **IP Rotation Logic**: Corrected the multi-record IP rotation logic to increment the rotation index instead of decrementing it, ensuring the IP window slides forward as expected. A unit test has been added to verify this behavior.
- **Documentation Accuracy**: The `README.md` has been updated to accurately reflect that the cron job runs every minute.
- The table view for "Rotate Based on a List of IPs (Multi-Records)" and other lists would break when the "Records" or "IP Pool" columns contained a large number of items. This has been fixed by summarizing long lists to show the first and last items.

## [2.6.3-dev] - 2025-08-01

### Fixed

- The table view for "Rotate Based on a List of IPs (Multi-Records)" and other lists would break when the "Records" or "IP Pool" columns contained a large number of items. This has been fixed by summarizing long lists to show the first and last items.

## [2.6.2-dev] - 2025-08-01

### Changed

- Renamed the IP rotation tools for clarity and consistency across the application.
  - "Manage Multi-Records Global Rotations" is now "Rotate Based on a List of IPs (Multi-Records)".
  - "Rotate Based on a List of IPs" is now "Rotate Based on a List of IPs (Single-Record)".
- Renamed the corresponding functions in `src/app.py` to match the new tool names.
- Updated `README.md` to reflect the new tool names.

## [2.6.1-dev2] - 2025-08-01

### Fixed

- Modified `src/logger.py` to only redirect `sys.stdout` and `sys.stderr` when the `LOG_TO_FILE` environment variable is set to `'true'`.
- Updated `install.sh` to set `LOG_TO_FILE=true` in the `run.sh` script that is executed by cron.

This ensures that the non-interactive cron job continues to have its output captured in the log files, while the interactive `cfu` command functions correctly by writing to the console.

## [2.6.1-dev1] - 2025-08-01

### Changed

- Replaced the simple file redirection for logging with a robust, application-level logging system using Python's `logging` module.
- Configured a `TimedRotatingFileHandler` to create a new log file daily, store it in a `logs/` directory, and automatically delete logs older than 7 days.
- Redirected `sys.stdout` and `sys.stderr` to the logger to ensure all script output, including uncaught exceptions, is captured.
- Updated the `install.sh` script to remove the old `log_file.log` and to call the application without shell-level output redirection.
- Updated `README.md` to reflect the new logging mechanism and location.

## [2.6.0-dev] - 2025-08-01

### Added

- **üåç Rotate Based on a List of IPs (Multi-Records)**: A new tool in the "IP Rotator Tools" menu that allows rotating a shared list of IPs across multiple DNS records in a synchronized, round-robin manner.
  - The rotation state (index) is persisted in a new `.cfutils-state.json` file, ensuring that the rotation continues from where it left off on each run.

## [2.5.0] - 2025-07-31

### Added

- **üîÅ Rotate IPs Between Records Tool**: A major new feature in the "IP Rotator Tools" menu.
  - Allows rotating the current IPs among multiple A/AAAA DNS records within the same zone ‚Äî no need for a predefined list.
  - Perfect for scenarios where you're cycling live IPs (e.g. load balancing, traffic obfuscation).
- **üóì Scheduled Rotation Groups**:
  - Create groups of records and schedule automatic IP rotations.
  - Includes a full CLI management UI for creating, editing, deleting groups, and viewing logs.
- **üìê Custom Rotation Order**:
  - Manual rotations now allow specifying the exact order of rotation for better control.

### Changed

- Improved menu structure and function names for better clarity and extensibility.
- Rotation command now supports user-defined order of how IPs are shifted between records.

### Fixed
