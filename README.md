# Cloudflare Utils

This project contains utilities to interact with Cloudflare DNS records, allowing for automated updates of DNS records using a specified set of IP addresses.

## Features

- Automatically rotate DNS records based on a list of IP addresses.
- Securely manage Cloudflare API tokens and other configuration via environment variables.
- Set up a cron job to periodically update DNS records.

## Prerequisites

- Ubuntu Server
- Git
- Python 3 and pip

## Installation

To install and set up the Cloudflare Utils on an Ubuntu server, follow these steps:

### Using cURL

Run the following command to download and execute the installation script using `curl`:

```bash
sudo bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Issei-177013/Cloudflare-Utils/main/install.sh)"
```

### Using wget

Alternatively, you can use `wget` to download and execute the installation script:

```bash
sudo bash -c "$(wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Issei-177013/Cloudflare-Utils/main/install.sh)"
```

## Configuration

During the installation process, you will be prompted to provide the following information:

- **Cloudflare API Token**: Your Cloudflare API token for authentication.
- **Cloudflare Zone ID**: The ID of the Cloudflare zone where your DNS records are located.
- **Cloudflare Record Name**: The name of the DNS record you want to update (e.g., `example.com`).
- **Cloudflare IP Addresses**: A comma-separated list of IP addresses to rotate through.

These values will be stored in your `~/.bashrc` file as environment variables.

## Usage

After the installation is complete, the setup script will automatically create a cron job that runs every 30 minutes. This cron job will execute the `run.sh` script, which in turn runs the `change_dns.py` script to update the DNS records.

### Manual Execution

If you need to manually trigger the DNS update, you can run the following command:

```bash
/opt/Cloudflare-Utils/run.sh
```

### Logs

The output of the cron job and the script executions will be logged in `/opt/Cloudflare-Utils/log_file.log`. You can check this log file to ensure that the updates are happening as expected.

## Contributing

## Tests

### Running Tests

To run the tests, make sure you have installed `pytest`:

```bash
pip install pytest
```

Then, you can run all the tests using:

```bash
pytest
```

### Test Coverage
The tests are designed to cover various aspects of the Cloudflare Utils project:

* Unit Tests: Tests for individual functions like fetching records, updating records, and IP rotation.
* Integration Tests: Tests that check the interaction between different components, such as fetching records and updating them with rotated IPs.
* Error Handling Tests: Tests to ensure proper error handling in case of API errors or invalid inputs.

### Adding New Tests
If you want to add new tests, follow these steps:

* Create a new test file in the tests/ directory, following the naming convention test_<feature>.py.
* Write your test cases using unittest or pytest.
* Run the tests locally to ensure they pass before making a pull request.

### Continuous Integration
We use continuous integration (CI) to automatically run tests on each pull request. Make sure all tests pass before merging your changes.
