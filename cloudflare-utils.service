# User and Group should be the user who runs the script, or a dedicated user.
# For simplicity, using User=%i and assuming the installer places it in the user's systemd directory,
# or a generic user if placed in /etc/systemd/system/.
# If installed system-wide, this might need to be a specific user like 'nobody' or a created 'cloudflare-utils' user,
# and PROGRAM_DIR might need to be accessible by that user.
# For now, assuming it's run by the user who installed it.
# EnvironmentFile=/opt/Cloudflare-Utils/.env # Systemd can load env files directly
